链接 [2251. Number of Flowers in Full Bloom](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-flowers-in-full-bloom/description/)

## 题目

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array flowers, where flowers[i] = [starti, endi] means the ith flower will be in full bloom from starti to endi (inclusive). You are also given a 0-indexed integer array people of size n, where people[i] is the time that the ith person will arrive to see the flowers.

Return an integer array answer of size n, where answer[i] is the number of flowers that are in full bloom when the ith person arrives.

## 题解

这题还是一个二分，把开始时间和结束时间排序，然后二分查找

```python
from bisect import bisect_left, bisect_right


class Solution:
    def fullBloomFlowers(
        self, flowers: list[list[int]], people: list[int]
    ) -> list[int]:
        start = sorted(s for s, e in flowers)
        end = sorted(e for s, e in flowers)
        return [bisect_right(start, p) - bisect_left(end, p) for p in people]
```
