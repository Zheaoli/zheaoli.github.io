## 题目

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

## 题解

这题没啥好说的，遍历求解

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        index = 0
        for i in range(len(t)):
            if index < len(s) and s[index] == t[i]:
                index += 1
        return index == len(s)
```
