链接 [1647. Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-character-frequencies-unique/description/)

## 题目

A string s is called good if there are no two different characters in s that have the same frequency.

Given a string s, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make s good.

The frequency of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For example, in the string "aab", the frequency of 'a' is 2, while the frequency of 'b' is 1.

```python
from collections import Counter


class Solution:
    def minDeletions(self, s: str) -> int:
        counter = Counter(s)
        index = {}
        for key, value in counter.items():
            index.setdefault(value, []).append(key)
        result = 0
        need_delete = sorted(filter(lambda x: len(index[x]) > 1, index.keys()), reverse=True)
        for i in need_delete:
            for _ in range(len(index[i]) - 1):
                for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                    if j not in index:
                        result += i - j
                        if j != 0:
                            index[j] = ["-1"]
                        break
        return result
```
